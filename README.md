# FTrace
FTrace is a simple ray tracer written in F# following [The Raytracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/), 
a test driven guide to developing your own ray tracer in whichever language you like.

## Why FSharp
I have always been interested in learning a functional language but I always found languages like Haskell overly intimidating and difficult to apply to real life situations.
But, I had discovered f# recently and found it a good choice thanks to it being part of .Net to finally actually learn a functional language but had no project to apply it to, until I found The Raytracer Challenge which is language agnostic.
The book proved tremendously useful as I could now code in f# without following a tutorial made with another paradigm like OOP in mind. 
The only challenge left was actually learning the language as there are scarce learning resources. The [FSharpForFunAndProfit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/) website proved invaluable in this aspect.
